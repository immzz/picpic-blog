Posts on screen is a technique allow event screen show audience post in real time. It could activate event atmosphere and collect audience opinion more efficiently. Speaking of technology, it sounds really hard to use. Today I am going to introduce an easy to use and super cool post on screen product and give step by step guidance to allow greenhand computer users to grasp this technique.

There are couple of high light features for this product:

1. There is a chat room corresponding to the screen. Audience can chat freely in the chat room, and like the interesting posts.

2. The product offers auto and manual mode: auto mode allows all posts show on screen automatically; manual mode allows posts to be filtered by manually.

3. You could also ban naughty audiences so they won’t be able to chat in the chat room.

Let’s first see how it looks:
