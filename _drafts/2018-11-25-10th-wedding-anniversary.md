Today's story is about love.

Picpic Live recently hosted two events related to love. One is a ten years wedding anniversary, the other is a wedding ceremony created by users we never met.

We were honoured to join and help with the wedding anniversary. Before going to the scene, my friends and I didn't know any details of the protagonist and the activities. We were only informed that they need the "glow stick" function. When we arrived, we found out that it was a surprise party. The hero has not yet arrived. Big letter J&S was on the screen, everything settled. Flowers candies and balloons are filled every Conor of the room. You can literally smell love and happiness in the air.

After a while, the crowd become quiet, all cameras aimed at the door. Two gentleman appeared. One is Chinese, and one is introduced to be of South African origin. Mr. Chinese apparently wasn't see this coming, very surprised. He is happy like child. Mr. South Africa walk towards his loved one with a bouquet of pink flowers. Smile overflowed from the hero's face, like a magic, infecting everyone in the room. It is late autumn nights, cold rain wet the street, but the atmosphere in the room is warm, warm to the heart.

Suddenly I realized that we were strangers 10 minute before. Just because of a product I have the honor to witness one of the most important moments in their life. Product is not just a product, it participated in every users life, merges with a ritual moment, carved in their memory. What a great pleasure it is. If we're not doing it with sincerity, how we can accept this gift and trust.


Thinking of the couple who gonna use Picpic Live for wedding intersection supporter, I am so honored and pleased that we can get in touch in this special way, beyond time and space, wish you very happy throw the screen.


Product has its soul. You can tell if it's creator likes simple or fancy. I always want to build something that has altitude and warm, life is a plane river, you can only triggers ripple if you do things dedicatedly.
